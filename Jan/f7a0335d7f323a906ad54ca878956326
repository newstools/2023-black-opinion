Yes 17c per kWh, while NERSA’s recent collective 31.9% electricity price increase will make each of us pay R3.15 kWh by next year, this won’t apply to South32. South32 enters into seperate power supply agreements with Eskom & NERSA decisions don’t apply to South32. In 2021, South32 renewed it’s power supply agreements with Eskom & extended this agreement for 10 years until 2031, so as electricity prices have increased by 300% for us over the past five years & while we can expect more of these hefty price increases from NERSA over the next 10 years, they won’t apply to South32, as South32 will continue paying the 17c flat rate until 2031. South32 Hillside smelter is the biggest smelter in the Southern Hemisphere & uses 5.5% of Eskom’s total energy generation, equivalent to the total energy generation capacity of Eskom’s single nuclear plant Koerberg Power Plant. South32 Hillside smelter is the biggest single electricity user in the country. But wait, there’s another aspect- South32 also has the Mozal Smelter 20km outside Maputo the capital of Mozambique & Eskom exports electricity to this smelter. The Mozal Smelter uses 4% of the total energy generation capacity of Eskom, so jointly South32 Hillside & Mozal smelters use 9% of Eskom energy generation capacity. Eskom’s energy generation mix is 85% coal & energy generation from coal costs Eskom 42c kWh so the discounted tariff prices of South32 costs Eskom R11 billion each year, so Eskom recovers all that money from each of us with every kWh we buy, that’s why South32 has contributed a 128% to the electricity price increases over the last decade for the entire country. If South32 had to shut it’s smelters today, that would reduce the electricity price cost we pay by nearly half & the generation capacity available to Eskom would end loadshedding today. Wait it doesn’t end there- over the past 30 years South32 has been an Eskom coal supplier supplying Eskom with 30 million tonnes of coal per year at R416 per tonne, despite the NERSA recommended rate being R350 per tonne, & such exorbitant coal cost have also contributed to the high electricity price costs to us, so in essence- South32 has been robbing us through it’s coal mining operations’ high cost of coal purchase price to Eskom, while on the other hand we also subsidize it’s smelters. A BIG BIG decades old scam. South32 is an Australian company robbing us blind.
